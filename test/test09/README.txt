Testing overflow results. 
STP loads x^3 into SA = 7.
EVP evaluates CV's in 7 with x = 1291. ('16b 0000 0101 0000 1011) 
Sum = 1000 0000 0100 0000 0001 1100 0011 0011;
The number is invalid due to user input creating overflow, but still produces 
the mathematically correct value (except that it technically now represents a
large negative number due to the 2's compliment format.)
